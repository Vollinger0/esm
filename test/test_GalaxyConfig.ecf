#== Count Limits ==
# Regions: Range from Child StarRegion_1 up to Child StarRegion_99
# Territories: Range from Child Territory_1 up to Child Territory_20
# Territories: You can set 1-10 Other_ factions to exist for this territory  (Other_1 > Other_10)
# Main-types (suntypes: unlimited)
# ===
# Special configuration: Dual-star systems
# CompanionStarClass: <value>  ; adding this parameter to a StarClass definition adds a 2nd star of the named value as compantion; 2nd star is decoration only;; <value> needs to be chosen from an already existing StarClass in this config!
# ===
# For the star models, we support these:
# Available Models: SunBlueGiant, SunWhiteDwarf, SunYellowWhite, SunYellow, SunRedGiant, SunRedDwarf, SunNeutron, BlackHole
# Customizing: You can add new IDs at the end of the list or modify the given ones. You can customize ALL parameters and use our own values, for example for StarClass (You can then use in your Sectors.yaml or SolarSystemConfg!). Only the models are limited to those mentioned above.
# Starter System: When your scenario does NOT use a fixed sectors.yaml with starterplanets, you can define one starter system in the General settings below. If you use a sectors.yaml with starter planets set AND have a starter system added below, the starter system entry in this galaxy config will not be used.
# Starter System Settings: The StarterSystemName can be freely chosen. The StarterSystemClass needs to be one defined in the IDs 1 and onwards.
# Territories > Factions available are: Zirax, Talon, Polaris, Kriel, Pirates, Trader, UCH, Civilian, Alien
# Territories > You can set up several individual territories for the same faction with different or overlapping coordinates and spheres!
# Territories > In a given territory, only the POI of the Territory-Faction will be placed. To allow other factions POI use the 'Other_' setting with an ongoing number. You can define the probability from center to edge of the territory!
# Internal calculation values: 
# 1 LJ = 10.000 AU = 100.000 Sectors (In reality one LY is about 65.000 AU, but the value was chosen for readability and better measurement)
# 1 AU = 10 Sectors
# Note: The coordinates of a territory or a sun (in the sectors.yaml f.ex), the GalaxySpawnRadius and the Radius of the Galaxy are given in LIGHTYEARS. The coordinates (min/max) of a zone of a Star (f.ex HabitableCold ), the coordinates of a planet in the sectors.yaml and the definitions given for planet, moon or station positions in the solarsystemconfigs are measured in SECTORS (not AU). Example: HabitableHot: "109, 120" > a planet in this zone is 109 to 120 SECTORS away from his star.

# ONLY PLAYERS EXPERIENCED WITH FILE EDITING SHOULD ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE STAR COUNT. DOING SO INCORRECTLY MAY CORRUPT YOUR SAVE GAME PERMANETLY.
# Directions for reducing the star count of the galaxy to help with long term server stability and save game size.
# The more playfields are generated, the more data is kept in the save game and the larger the database grows.
# This can cause issues on larger servers the longer the save game is run.
# Reducing the star count will lower the total number of playfields in the galaxy which may help, but it is not a guarantee.
# Not useful for smaller servers or single player where you will simply never generate most of the star systems anyway.

# Notepad++ or equivalent text editor is recommended!

# TO PREVIEW YOUR CHANGES IN A TEST GAME:
# 1: Start a new test save game using the scenario.
# 2: While still running the game, alt-tab out and go to your save game's Content/Configuration folder in file explorer.
    # For example: Empyrion - Galactic Survival\Saves\Games\NewGame\Content\Configuration
# 3: Open up GalaxyConfig.ecf and change the StarCount to whatever min and max values you want to try then save the file.
# 4: Tab back to the game and open the console and type (without the quotes) "galaxy".
# 5: Open the galaxy map and look at how the galaxy appears.
# 6: Repeat until you're satisfied with the galaxy star count.
# 7: Take note of the average warp distance between the stars. You may need to increase the warp drive range so players do not get stuck.


# TO CHANGE THE STAR COUNT:
# 1: After copying the scenario files to your server, but before starting the save game for the first time, open up the GalaxyConfig.ecf file in the scenario files you just copied over.
    # The file is under Content\Configuration in the scenario.
# 2: Change the StarCount values to whatever min and max value you want. The game will generate a galaxy with a total number of stars between those two values.
    # For example: StarCount: "28000, 30000"
# 3: Save and close the file, then start a new save game on the server. The new galaxy will have the star count specified.
# NOTE: Never change the galaxy config file under the save game folder for any existing save game as it can corrupt the database of that save. Always use a throwaway test save to preview changes to the galaxy config before starting your save game.


# TO CHANGE THE WARP DRIVE RANGE:
# 1: Open up either the Config_PE.ecf or Config_RE.ecf files under the Content/Configuration folder in the scenario. Config_PE is for Project Eden and Config_RE is for Reforged Eden.
# 2: Change the RangeLY value to whatever you want for each warp drive type.
    # Note: Do not set any warp drive to longer than a 100ly range, as this will let players bypass the ancient warp gate and warp directly to the decay star cluster.
    # Note2: Remember that the basic warp drive gets up to +50ly range from navigational data, while the advanced warp drive gets +100ly range from navigational data.
# 3: Save the file as Config.ecf in the Content/Configuration folder.
# 4: Scenario updates shouldn't remove your changes.
# WARNING: The Config.ecf file is no longer supported by the developers. In the future you may have to make the warp drive changes directly to the BlocksConfig.ecf file and therefor will need to redo your changes each time you update the scenario.
